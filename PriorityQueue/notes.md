# Priority Queue

## Introduction

A priority queue is an important data structure that is similar to the queue and stack data structures
that stores data along with the priority associated with them. In this, the data is served according
to the priority. Priority queues can be implemented using an array, linked list, and trees; however,
they are often implemented using a heap as it is very efficient.
