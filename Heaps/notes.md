# Heaps

## Introduction

A heap data structure is a tree-based data structure in which each node of the tree has a specific
relationship with other nodes, and they are stored in a specific order. Depending upon the specific
order of the nodes in the tree, heaps can be of different types, such as a min heap and a max heap.

## Min Heap

The min-heap is a tree data structure where each node is smaller than or equal to its children.
The root is always the smallest element.

## Max-Heap

The max-heap is a data structure where each node is greater or equal to its children
The root is always the biggest element.

## Binary Heap

The binary heap is a complete binary tree that respects the heap property.

1. Complete Binary Tree - a complete binary tree is a binary tree where every level is completely filled expect maybe the last one but all its nodes have to be as far to the left as possible.
2. Heap property - each node is smaller than or equal to its children if its a min heap and each node should be larger than its children if its a max heap.
