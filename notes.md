# Techniques Notes

## The two sum problem with O(n) and constant space

### Sliding window

Sliding window is used for subarrays

### hashmaps

we can get a solution using hashmaps but the space complexity is going to be O(n)

### Two Pointers

With two pointers we can get the solution with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity
