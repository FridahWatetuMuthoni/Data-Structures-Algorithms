# Techniques Notes

## The two sum problem with O(n) and constant space

### Sliding window

Sliding window is used for subarrays

### hashmaps

we can get a solution using hashmaps but the space complexity is going to be O(n)

### Two Pointers

With two pointers we can get the solution with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity

## Breadth First and Depth First Traversal

### Depth First Traversal => Go deep

We use a stack when we do depth first traversals, thats why we can do it usig recursion.
Depth first search comes with three favours, inroder, postorder and preorder

## Breadth First Traversal => Go wide => FIFO

We use a queue and iteration to perform a breadth first traversal on graphs or trees
