1. Problem: Given a directed graph, detect if there is a cycle.

2. Problem: Given an unweighted graph, find the shortest path between two nodes using BFS.

3. Problem: Determine if a given graph is bipartite.
A graph is bipartite if you can color the graph using two colors such that no two adjacent nodes have the same 

4. Problem: Find the shortest path in a weighted graph.Dijkstra's Algorithm.

5. Problem: Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG), perform topological sorting.

6. Find all nodes having length of shortest path from a node equal to 2
